## Program 2 - Processing in Linear Time
#### Faith Howell


### Linear Time Lookup

This project is about loading a singly linked list with dictionary words, 
then timing how it takes to look them up. We are doing this with the knowledge 
that this is slow, and we plan on applying our "lookup" code to other backend data structures with better performance.
